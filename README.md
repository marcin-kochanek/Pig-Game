# Pig-Game

Pig Game is very simple, but also fun dice/two-dice game I made while learning JS (in The Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy taught by Jonas Schmedtmann). 

GAME RULES 

1. For one dice (use the following script: scripts/app.js)

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

2. For two dices (use the following script: scripts/app_challenge_3.js)

- Before the game a player can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100. 
- The player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. 
- The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.
